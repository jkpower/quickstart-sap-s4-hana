# quickstart-sap-s4-hana
## SAP S/4HANA on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys SAP S/4HANA in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in 1.5-2.5 hours. This Quick Start is for SAP Architects, System Administrators, and IT Technical Professionals who are responsible for architecture design and the deployment of S/4HANA workloads on AWS.

Using this Quick Start, you can deploy an S/4HANA system cluster that consists of a HANA database, an ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) server, and a primary application server (PAS) into a new virtual private cloud (VPC), with or without installing SAP software. Or you can deploy the S/4HANA cluster into an existing VPC. 

In each deployment option, you can choose whether to include an additional application server (AAS) and whether to use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) or Network File System (NFS). For a complete list of deployment options, see the [deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/vY8pN).

This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy SAP S/4HANA in a single AWS Region across two Availability Zones.
